RestCrumbs
==========

This directory contains the RestCrumbs publisher.

RestCrumbs, standing for reStructured Text Crumbs, are single-file
text documents written using `reStructured Text`_ and intended to be
published online to reflect thoughts, knowledge, opinions, and other
matters expressible in written form. 

.. _`reStructured Text`: http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html

The software supports versioning and linking of crumbs, and provides a
*tool box* of editing and translation scripts for online publishing.

The mission of this software is to:

- make writing *easy* - "just text", no markup, for all simple documents;

- make documents *historical* - the evolution of a document is exposed;

- make documents *reusable* - the content can be copy-and-pasted in
  other tools or transformed in other formats so they can be reused as
  *parts* of other documents.

This last mission item is what distinguishes this tool from online
publishing platforms like WordPress that use HTML as a common format:
reST documents can be transformed automatically into valid and
properly-structured LaTeX code, OpenOffice documents, etc.


The RestCrumbs publisher is free software. See the file LICENSE for
usage and copying conditions.


Usage and features
------------------

The software provides tools to:

- resolve inter-crumb text links to working reST references;

- generate static PDF and HTML versions of the documents;

- generate a semi-dynamic web interface to view and download the
  documents;

- derive embeddable LaTeX code from crumbs, for example for further
  manual collation in books, reports, etc.;

- keep track and document the history of crumbs.

The software assumes the existence of a *crumbs repository* (really,
just a directory with a bunch of text files in it) set up using any
third-party revision control system.

The tools take the form of Unix shell scripts, Python scripts, and
``make`` rules.

Requirements
------------

This software depends on the following:

- Python Docutils: http://docutils.sourceforge.net/

- Sphinx Python Documentation Generator: http://sphinx.pocoo.org/

- a recent TeX/LaTeX distribution;

- other requirements related to the reST features used in crumbs,
  e.g. pertaining to graphics, math writing, etc.
