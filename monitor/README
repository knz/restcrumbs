To use the monitor, place it in a location that can be served with
HTTP.

Then configure, for example with Apache::

    <VirtualHost *:80>
       ServerName notes.example.com
       DocumentRoot /home/notes/www-publish
       ScriptAlias /controller/cgi-bin /home/notes/controller/cgi-bin
       Alias /controller /home/notes/controller
       CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/notes.log combined
       <Directory /home/notes/controller>
            AuthType Basic
            AuthName "Notes control"
            AuthBasicProvider file
            AuthUserFile /home/notes/htpasswd
            Require user notes
       </Directory>
    </VirtualHost>

The idea here is that the directory "www-publish" will contain the
public-facing documents, whereas the special URL alias "/controller"
needs authentication as it causes rebuilding the content.
